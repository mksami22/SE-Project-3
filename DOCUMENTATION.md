# Functionalities added to the older version:

## Making flash cards using ChatGPT

In the previous version, flash cards were created using google. In this version, you have the option to choose to create the flash cards using ChatGPT 4 which is more accuarate and reliable). [OpenAI API Key reference.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction)

## Drop down menu added

We changed the user interface and added a drop down menu. now users can choose whether google or ChatGPT generated the flash cards for them.

## Answer search

In the previous version, only a relevant web link for a question was being extracted. In this version, we search the web for the relevant answers as well, and then find the best answer. Therefore, we do only show the user different questions but provide an end-to-end solution with both questions and answers.

## Anki Integration

We integrated a software tool called Anki with the current code, so that the question and answers can be stored as flashcards on Anki.

## Anki Decks

For each lecture, we create a deck, and then create multiple cards in the deck. Each card in the denotes a single question answer pair. We also developed logic to correctly store the cards, for Anki to use later.

## Improved UI

We made several improvements to the UI. For example, user can provide custom deck names, and specify where to store decks. We also made the onboarding easier to make the process of generating decks easier.

## Improved Test coverage (64% -> 96%)

We significantly improved the test coverage from 64% to 96%. To improve the coverage, we did not only write several additional tests, but also removed any redundant code that was not being used.

### Improved Documentation

We generated the code documentation using a new format called Pycco. We also revamped the readme and other docs for better readability and user experience.
